## Brief Description

This course describes and demonstrates effective strategies for using propensity score methods to address the potential for selection bias in observational studies comparing the effectiveness of treatments or exposures. We review the main analytical techniques associated with propensity score methods, (focusing on matching, weighting and double robust techniques) and describe key strategic concerns related to effective propensity score estimation, assessment and display of covariate balance, choice of analytic technique, stability and sensitivity analyses, and communicating results effectively.

The workshop provides a useful experience for statisticians and others who are familiar with regression models and have some experience with studies comparing treatments, but does not mandate prior experience with applying propensity methods. Attendees will receive access to R Markdown files and other software tools to carry out techniques demonstrated in the session. Although we focus on established approaches to dealing with design and analytical challenges, we conclude the session by reviewing recent methodological advances in propensity scores and application of propensity score methods to problems in health policy research.

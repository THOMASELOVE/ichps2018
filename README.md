Materials for ICHPS 2018 Workshop: **Designing and Analyzing Observational Health Policy Studies Using Propensity Scores**
Wednesday 2018-01-10 8 - 10 AM in the Crystal Ballroom CD at the Charleston Marriott Hotel, in Charleston, SC

This course describes and demonstrates effective strategies for using propensity score methods to address the potential for selection bias in observational studies comparing the effectiveness of treatments or exposures. We review the main analytical techniques associated with propensity score methods, (focusing on matching, weighting and double robust techniques) and describe key strategic concerns related to effective propensity score estimation, assessment and display of covariate balance, choice of analytic technique, stability and sensitivity analyses, and communicating results effectively.

The workshop provides a useful experience for statisticians and others who are familiar with regression models and have some experience with studies comparing treatments, but does not mandate prior experience with applying propensity methods. Attendees will receive access to R Markdown files and other software tools to carry out techniques demonstrated in the session. Demonstrations will use the latest versions of R and R Studio, and attendees are free to either follow along on their own machines, or review the code later, at their convenience.

This workshop is a new version of the speaker's prior award-winning workshops in this field, to make deeper use of modern software tools available in R. Although we focus on established approaches to dealing with design and analytical challenges, we conclude the session by reviewing recent methodological advances in propensity scores and application of propensity score methods to problems in health policy research.

The speaker is Thomas E. Love, Ph.D., who is Professor of Medicine, Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University, and has wide experience with applying and teaching statistical methods for observational studies to diverse audiences. Dr. Love is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.

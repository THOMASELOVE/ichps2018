- A student of mine, David Ngendahimana, is working on the problem of improving the link between covariate balance and improved sensitivity in selecting a matching procedure. We hope to have something arXived and available for testing on github in the Spring, but David is finishing the other two-thirds of his dissertation first. David is at `dkn18 at case dot edu`.

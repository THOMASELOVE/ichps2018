# Work from Other People

## Elizabeth Stuart's Propensity Score Software Page

- Elizabeth Stuart's [Propensity Score software page](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~estuart/propensityscoresoftware.html) remains incredibly useful.

## Videos To Learn More About Propensity Scores (and if you visit any of these, you'll find many more)

- Jason Roy (Penn) has a Crash Course in Causality [at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality).
- Kristin Rankin has a session on [Propensity Score Matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZVIfW6_v1U)
- Ben Lambert has a series of YouTube videos on [Propensity Score Matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0UU6trKR0E)
- Doug McKee has posted [An Intuitive Introduction to Propensity Score Matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACVyPp1Fy6Y)
- Gary King has a lecture entitled [Why Propensity Scores Should Not Be Used for Matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBv39pK1iEs)

## Software

- Noah Griefer's [cobalt vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cobalt/vignettes/cobalt_basic_use.html)
- RAND corporation's [TWANG package materials](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twang/index.html)
- Luke Keele's [Rbounds package](http://www.personal.psu.edu/ljk20/rbounds.html)
- A student of mine, David Ngendahimana, is working on the problem of improving the link between covariate balance and improved sensitivity in selecting a matching procedure. We hope to have something arXived and available for testing on github in the Spring, but David is finishing the other two-thirds of his dissertation first. David is at `dkn18 at case dot edu`.
